  CHANGELOG tasks.php:
    20 October 2018     - File created.
    25-27 November 2018 - Wrote method to push all data into objects.
                        - Learnt about PDO::FETCH_CLASS
    28 November 2018    - Array is now indexed by task_id
    6 December 2018     - renderlist() method outputs entire list of tasks
    8 December 2018     - Changed renderlist() to two render() methods so
                          the task object will render itself.
    28 December 2018    - Can now mark tasks as complete. This is done through
                          an AJAX call from tasks.js which initiates markdelete.php.
    29 December 2018    - Updated database connector to use a global variable.
                          It's okay, my art teacher said it was fine.
